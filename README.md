In this repsoitory, a classification model based on sound waves is given. The model mostly targets impbalanced data handling using robust random distribution approach. 
The model is based on the Keras Neural Network and the data is feeded using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features. The mfcc features are extracted using pre-defined python liberaries.
A minimum saple to detect is cosidered 1/10 of a second with standard 16KHz frequency. In mfcc features extraction the configuration is chosen as  nfilt=26, nfeat=13, nfft=512, rate=16000
In the notebook, all necessary instruction are commented to help.
Hope it work for you.
